# MainQuestNoble
After a random noble tells you that another noble knows more about the Battle of Pendraic, the mod will start tracking the position of that noble on the campaign map if they are in a party or an army.

The mod will fail to track their position if for example they are a prisoner or they are resting in a settlement.

If they are resting in a settlement (not a dungeon), a yellow exclamation mark icon will be added to the settlement's nameplate, but not their overlay or party nameplate.

Also, the mod can only track one noble at a time, which is the last noble mentioned by the random noble.

The mod will stop tracking the positions of nobles when you talk to any quest noble about the Battle of Pendraic.

Thus, players won't have to keep checking the encyclopedia to track the position of the quest noble they want to talk to.

This mod requires Harmony.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
